# Cluster
Hey, this is a project by Tel Aviv University's Programming project course. 
The program is written in C, its built by a few modules gathered together to a package named Cluster.
In this project, Omer and I implemented an algorithm for detecting community structures in a network. The program receives two arguments - 
(1) an input file name that points to a binary file that holds the input matrix representing the network, (2) and an output file name that will hold the network seperated to groups.


Developing this algorithm took us about 2 months. During this time I learned how to use git, so you can probably see that the commits might be wierd some times..
