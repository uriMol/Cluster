# Cluster
Hey, this is a project by Tel Aviv University's Programming project course. 
The program is written in C, its built by a few modules gathered together to a package named Cluster.
In this project, Omer and I implemented an algorithm for detecting community structures in a network. The program receives two arguments - 
(1) an input file name that points to a binary file that holds the input matrix representing the network, (2) and an output file name that will hold the network seperated to groups.

# About our work
Developing this algorithm took us about 2 months. During this time I learned how to use git, so you can probably see that the commits might be wierd some times..  We kept a google doc to document all of our progress and kept is up to date every day we worked, keeping tracks of changes, tasks, tests and input files.
Building this kind of algorithm doesn't have to take that long, it's the running time improvements that we implemented that took us the time.
